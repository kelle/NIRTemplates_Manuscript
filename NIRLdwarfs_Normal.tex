\section{Introduction}

L~dwarfs, star-like objects cooler than M~dwarfs and comprised of both the lowest mass stars and the most massive brown dwarfs, were first discovered in large numbers and classified in the late 1990's and early 2000's with the advent of large-sky near-infrared (NIR) photometric surveys such as the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS, REF), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, REF), and the Deep Near Infrared Survey (DENIS, REF). \citep{K99,Martin99,K00,Hawley02,Kendall04,Knapp04}. 
Building upon those initial discoveries, previous papers in this series focused on identifying a volume-limited sample of field late-M and L dwarfs to measure their number density and luminosity function \citep[Papers V, IX, and X]{Cruz03,Cruz07,Reid08}. SEGUE TO CLASSIFICATION: WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?

M and L dwarfs were first classified according to their spectral morphology at red-optical wavelengths \citep{K99,Kirkpatrick05}. BRIEFLY DESCRIBE PRIMARY SPECTRAL FEATURES? With their intrinsically low luminosities and cool surface temperatures, L dwarfs emit most of their flux at near-infrared wavelengths. Significant advances in near-infrared detector technology and instrumentation in the last several decades have enabled the detailed, high-quality observations of large numbers of substellar objects (REFs for SpeX, NIRSPEC, TripleSpec, FIRE). Characterization of an even larger number of objects will be possible with the infrared instrumentation on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), scheduled for launch in 2018.

However, the direct inference of accurate, precise, and unambiguous physical properties from their near-infrared spectral classification eludes brown dwarf researchers. The spectral energy distribution of L dwarfs deviates significantly from a blackbody function, and their spectral morphology is dominated by pressure-broadened alkali lines and deep molecular absorption bands.  

Red-optical spectra of L dwarfs are on the Wien side of the underlying blackbody spectrum, and the spectral morphology in that wavelength regime is indeed dominated by temperature effects, with surface gravity and metallicity only making secondary contributions that are clearly distinguished as perturbations on an spectral classification that otherwise fits into the optical sequence (REFs). For example, \citet{Cruz09} defined gravity suffixes ($\beta$, \$gamma$, and \$delta$) for optical L dwarf spectral types and Burgasser (REF) identified low-metallicity L subdwarfs following the spectral classification scheme established for M dwarfs (LEPINE REF).  

However, spectral classification in the near-infrared has been fraught with inconsistencies and degeneracies so that objects have different spectral types in the optical and in the near-infrared and objects with the same near-infrared spectral type display a range of morphologies in their $JHK$ spectra. \citet{Kirkpatrick10} defined L dwarf near-infrared spectral standards based on their spectral morphology in the $J$-band, but these objects display an unsettling diversity in the $H$ and $K$ bands, including $J-K$ colors that differ from the average for their spectral type. \citep{Allers13} defines quantitative spectral indices to identify spectral type and surface gravity class using low-resolution near-infrared spectra, but use of the entire spectral region to assign a type is necessary to parallel the MK system established for stars \citep{Morgan84}.

This is a challenging project, because in the near-infrared, the dependence of spectral morphology on underlying physical properties is much more enabled than in the optical. For example, the peaky $H$-band shape associated with low surface gravity (REFs) is also sensitive to temperature \citep(Allers13), and a redder than average spectral energy distribution can be attributed to lower temperature and/or enhanced atmospheric dust\citep{Looper08_dusty,Geissler2011,Gizis12_0047}. Furthermore, composite spectral morphology can introduce feature that defy classification \citep{Cruz04,Burgasser07_0805,Geissler2011,Burgasser08_0320}.

Of the peculiar objects, the low-gravity objects are of particular interest because they are expected to overlap in physical properties of temperature, gravity, dust properties, and perhaps even mass, with hot Jupiters and directly-imaged exoplanets. Some free-floating and wide companion brown dwarfs that show low-gravity spectral features can be kinematically associated with a nearby young moving group, providing an independent age constraint and enabling age-calibrated studies of spectral features and physical properties (Faherty et al., in prep, Filippazzo in prep., Hiranaka et al., in prep.).

Therefore we have developed an empirical, descriptive near-infrared spectral classification system for field and young L dwarfs. The system is derived from a sample of L dwarfs with both optical and near-infrared spectra (described in Section \ref{sec:sample}). We describe a method of normalizing in individual bands in order to remove color information and focus on characterization of morphology in the $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands individually (Section~\ref{sec:method}). In Section~\ref{sec:templates} we describe the creation of spectral temples for field L0--L8, low gravity L0--L4$\gamma$, and intermediate-gravity L0 \& L1$\beta$ spectral types, and in Sections~\ref{sec:fieldg} and \ref{sec:lowg} we analyze the spectral morphology of the templates. In Section~\ref{sec:classification} we detail our procedure for determining the spectral type of an object from the comparison of observed low-resolution $J$-, $H$-, and/or $K$-band spectra to our templates, and in Section\ref{sec:summary} we summarize our conclusions.

%Detailed follow-up investigations have identified features in the spectra of L dwarfs that are indicative of the objects being: old, as indicated by features attributed to low-metallicity \citep{Burgasser08_blue}; young, as indicated by features attributed to low-gravity \citep{Kirkpatrick08,Cruz09_lowg}; dusty, as indicated by a redder than average spectral energy distribution attributed to atmospheric dust \citep{Looper08_dusty,Geissler2011,Gizis12_0047}; or multiple, as indicated by features attributed to composite spectral morphology \citep{Cruz04,Burgasser07_0805,Geissler2011,Burgasser08_0320}.

%Most recently, L dwarfs have warranted attention because of their physical and spectral similarities to hot and massive planetary-mass companions to young stars. 
%Despite having different masses, L dwarfs and young, giant planets can have similar temperatures and both have condensate clouds in their photospheres that dominate their emergent spectra.
%Indeed, the first spectra of objects widely considered planets display a striking resemblance to the spectra of L dwarfs. (2M1207: \citet{Patience10}

From Neill:
first, would it be correct to say that overall rationale for the paper is the hypothesis that optical spectral types for L dwarfs have a closer tie to fundamental parameters (notable effective temperature) than IR types, and the aim of this paper is to provide a means of deriving spectral types from near-IR data that are more closely consistent with the optical scale? The approach adopted is to assume that the near-infrared spectra results from two factors: an overall slope, that's driven largely by continuum emisson/absorption due to dust within the atmosphere; and features, that are more closely tied to the temperature. The spectral type calibration then follows from an empirical set of templates that are designed to put greater emphasis on the feature strength than the spectral slope.

Given how important the NIR spectral region is as a diagnostic for the fundamental properties of both L~dwarfs and giant exoplanets, we have undertaken a concerted effort to disentangle and isolate the spectral features due to temperature, gravity, metallicity, and multiplicity. In particular, we have combined new and existing optical and NIR data for L~dwarfs in order to use the optical spectra as the anchor for the NIR spectral analysis. 
A major motivation for the work presented here is the philosophy that before we can understand these extreme and peculiar L~dwarfs and L~dwarf-like exoplanets, our understanding of ``normal'' L dwarfs must be grounded. 

% In \S~\ref{sec:obs} we present new low-resolution and moderate resolution near-infrared spectra of normal late-M and L~dwarfs and likely galaxies.  
% We define ``normal'' and combine new data and literature to create a sample of \sample~normal L~dwarfs with both optical and NIR spectra in \S~\ref{sec:sample}.
% In \S~\ref{sec:method}, we describe new method for normalizing NIR spectra that effectively removes the reddening term present in the L~dwarf spectra and enables the strength of the temperature-sensitive absorption features to be more easily compared.
% We describe how we use the optical spectra as an anchor for our NIR analysis to generate spectral average templates and isolate temperature effects in the NIR spectra in \S~\ref{sec:analysis}.
% In \S~\ref{sec:classification}, we outline a spectral classification scheme for L~dwarfs using only NIR data. 
% Finally, we summarize and conclude in \S~\ref{sec:summary}. 
% In the Appendix, we show NIR spectra of objects that are suspected to be galaxies.

\subsection{Motivation}
While there has been much progress in the interpretation of the \emph{optical} spectra of L dwarfs \citep{K99,Cruz09_lowg}, reliable diagnostics based on near-infrared (NIR) data are necessary for two primary reasons:
1) L dwarfs are intrinsically very cool and thus faint in the optical and obtaining optical spectra of them is resource intensive and 
2) the workhorse spectrographs of the next decade are optimized for the NIR, e.g., Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSPEC) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Folded-port Infrared Echellette (FIRE) on Magellan, Near-Infrared Echelle Spectrograph (NIRES) on Keck, and the TripleSpec instruments on the ARC 3.5-m, Palomar 200-inch, and the Blanco 4-m.

Ever since their discovery, the NIR properties of L dwarfs have proved more complex to interpret than their behavior at optical wavelengths. 
This was first recognized in their photometric properties where, unlike M~dwarfs, L~dwarfs of the same optically-based spectral type span a large range of $J-K$ colors \citep[e.g.,]{Leggett:2003tm}. 
That is, we observe a wide range of spectral morphologies for sources with similar optical spectral types.
This scatter has been attributed to temperature dominating spectral variations in the optical but gravity and condensate cloud differences playing a significant role on the observed NIR spectral features \citep{Knapp04}.
Thus, different underlying masses and cloud properties cause a wider range of spectral morphologies at a given temperature (spectral type) resulting in the range of NIR colors. 
This sensitivity of the NIR spectra to second order parameters in addition to temperature has made a satisfying NIR-based classification scheme for L dwarfs elusive and beguiled reliable and consistent interpretation of their spectra.
While there were numerous efforts to classify L dwarfs with spectral indices \citep{Reid01_NIR, Testi01, Geballe02}, a classification system for L~dwarfs based on NIR data grounded in the Morgan Keenan system did not emerge until recently. \citet{Kirkpatrick10} (hereafter K10) developed a classification scheme that focuses heavily on the J-band spectral morphology and results in types consistent with the optically-determined types. 

Allers uses indices.

%============
% MODELS
%===========
% The focus of this work is to isolate spectral features in the NIR due to temperature from those due to gravity and/or cloud properties.  
% In Figure #, we show four Saumon and Marley models (REF?) all at 1800 K, but with different gravities and cloud properties. 
% We have chosen 1800 K because it roughly corresponds to L4-L5 which is at the cool end of the relevant temperature range discussed here and where the cloud and gravity properties play the largest role. We have chosen g300 and g1000 and f1 and f3 as the parameters that likely bracket the range of gravities and cloud properties commonly expected in L dwarfs ranging from 10 Myr We show low (thick puffy lines) and field (thin lines) gravities with thicker (red) and thinner (black) clouds, all at 1800 K. 
% In the NIR, despite having the same temp, the H and K band spectral morphologies are quite different. (Even in the H-band slope that Allers et al. 2013 claim to be cloud and gravity insensitive.) 
% Thus, without optical or J band data, it is very difficult to reliably determine a temperature from NIR spectra. 
% In our effort to figure out what we *can* reliably say about the underlying physical properties of L dwarfs based soley on their NIR spectra, in the following sections, we explore the spectral morphologies spanned by field L dwarfs of the same temperature, by using optical spectral type as an anchor. 
% 
% (We also mark the two regions in the optical regime that Cruz et al. 2009 hypthesized to be most sensitive to clouds/gravity (0.74-0.8) and less sensitive (0.8-0.84).
% We note that the models show those to be good choices.)

We have combined extant spectra from the literature with new data to create a sample of \sample~L~dwarfs with both far-red optical (6000–-9000~\AA) and low-resolution SpeX prism spectra (0.85--2.4~$\micron$) which we refer to collectively as the ``optical-NIR sample''. 
Of these 360 optical and NIR spectra, \# are published here for the first time and are listed in Tables~\ref{tab:newopt} and~\ref{tab:newnir}. 
% : \newopt~new optical spectra  are listed in 
% and \prismspectra~new SpeX prism NIR spectra are listed in 
The full sample is divvied up into Tables~\ref{tab:field_template}--\ref{tab:lowg_excluded}.

Our campaign to obtain spectroscopy of L dwarfs was initiated as part of our effort to complete the 20~pc census of nearby ultracool dwarfs using 2MASS. Photometric selection criteria were used to identify candidate nearby ultracool dwarfs in the 2MASS catalog. The selection criteria and sample creation are described extensively in \cite{Cruz03,Cruz07,Reid08} (Papers~III, V, and IX). Candidates were then targeted for far-red optical and/or near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up to obtain spectral types and photometric distances. Our NIR follow-up campaign was focused on candidate nearby ultracool dwarfs that were too faint for optical follow-up. In addition, in an effort to compile an extensive library of NIR spectra of ultracool dwarfs, we also targeted optically-confirmed nearby M and L dwarfs from our own work as well as from the literature. This large spectral dataset formed the basis of the ``optical-NIR sample''.

Our goal was to make the optical-NIR sample as representative as possible of the entire L~dwarf population. 
However, as shown in Figure~3 of \cite{Schmidt10}, the 2MASS-based photometrically selected samples that are the focus of previous papers in this series \citep{Cruz03, Reid08} are biased against the bluer L~dwarfs at every spectral type. 
Since most of our spectroscopic follow-up focused on a red-biased sample, our optical-NIR spectroscopic sample is prone to also be red biased. 
In order to make the optical-NIR sample as representative as possible of the entire L~dwarf population, we made a concerted effort to identify L dwarfs in the literature with bluer than average colors with both optical and SpeX Prism spectra.
Specifically, we looked for L~dwarfs in the literature with $J-K_S$ colors bluer than the range of colors spanned by the 2MASS-selected sample. 

\subsection{Sample properties}

The spectral type distribution of the optical-NIR sample is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:newdata_spthist} 
The sample includes \optNormal~total field gravity objects with optical types spanning L0--L8 (gray and black).
%With less than 15 objects, the L6--L8 bins suffer the most from small numbers.
The sample also includes \optLowG~low-gravity objects from L0--L4 (orange, red). 
While there are more low-gravity objects known based on optical data, many lack SpeX Prism data due to their southerly declinations and inaccessibility from the IRTF.
Objects with new spectra presented in this paper are indicated with hatching.

The $J-K_S$ color distribution of the optical-NIR sample is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:JK_colors}.

The properties of the field and low gravity samples are discussed in more detail in \S\S~\ref{sec:templates_normal} and~\ref{sec:templates_lowg}.

\subsection{Far-Red Optical Spectra}

%describe optical spectra
For an L dwarf to be included in the optical-NIR sample, it is required to have an optical spectrum of high enough signal-to-noise ratio ($\gtrsim$50) to get a reliable spectral type.
The optical spectra were obtained with long-slit spectrographs-telescope combinations all with similar resolving power~($\lambda/\Delta\lambda\sim1000$). 
The instrumental setup and data reduction techniques used for each spectrum is described in the references listed in Tables~\ref{tab:field_template}--\ref{tab:lowg_excluded}.
Every spectrum was visually compared to spectral standards in order to estimate spectral types using the schemes of \citet{K99} and \cite{Cruz09_lowg} for field and low gravity spectra respectively.  
%The resulting spectral types are listed in Table \ref{tab:newopt} and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:newopt}.

%Most data were reduced with the \emph{doslit} routine in the CCDRED IRAF package while the GMOS data were reduced with the Gemini GMOS IRAF package. Most of the Keck-LRIS data are telluric-corrected, while most others are not; however, the telluric lines do not significantly change the shape of the optical spectrum and do not affect the spectral type. 

%We include in our analysis four objects for which optical spectra and optical spectral classification exists, but for which we did have been unable to get the spectra. The data have been visually inspected in the figures in their respective papers: only 0034-0706.

Here we present new optical spectra for 16 objects from the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on the 10~m Keck Telescope \citep[LRIS]{LRIS} and one from the Low Dispersion Spectrograph on the Magellan 6.5~m Clay Telescope \citep[LDSS-3]{LDSS2}.
The targets, telescopes, and observation dates are listed in Table~\ref{tab:newopt}. 
The data were obtained and reduced in the same manner as described in \citet{Kirkpatrick10}. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:newdata_spthist}, these new far-red optical data are indicated in the spectral type distribution of the entire optical-NIR sample with left hatching.
The spectra are shown in Figure Set~\ref{fig:newopt}.

\subsection{Near-Infrared Spectra}

In addition to a far-red optical spectrum, for an L dwarf to be included in the optical-NIR sample, it is required to have a spectrum obtained with the SpeX spectrograph \citep{Spex} on the 3~m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility using the low-resolution prism mode providing wavelength coverage of 0.8--2.5~$\micron$ in a single order and an average resolving power of $\lambda/\Delta\lambda\sim120$.
%with a 0$\farcs$5-wide slit. 
SpeX Prism mode has proved to be a popular workhorse instrument for brown dwarf spectroscopic follow-up and as a result, there are a plethora of data. And thanks to the efforts of Adam J. Burgasser, much of this data is publicly available\footnote{Spex Prism Spectral Library: \url{http://pono.ucsd.edu/~adam/browndwarfs/spexprism/}}.

Here we present \prismspectra~new SpeX prism spectra of \objects~L dwarfs. 
Observations were obtained over 28 nights during 2003--2011. The targets, observation dates, and \emph{optical} spectral types are listed in Table~\ref{tab:newnir}. 
The targets were observed dithered pairs (ABBA) to enable pair-wise subtraction. A0 dwarfs were observed at a similar airmass and time as the target to provide both telluric and flux calibration.
The data were flat-fielded, extracted, wavelength calibrated, and telluric corrected with Spextool \citep{Cushing04,Spextool2}.
In the spectral type distribution of the entire optical-NIR sample shown in Figure~\ref{fig:newdata_spthist}, objects with new NIR SpeX Prism data are indicated with right hatching.
%The spectra are not shown individually but are included in Figures~\ref{fig:field_templates}--\ref{fig:field_excluded} and \ref{fig:beta_templates}--\ref{fig:lowg_excluded}.

In the Appendix, we discuss objects that NIR spectra revealed to not be ultracool dwarfs and instead are suspected to be galaxies.

%The data were acquired in a variety of weather and seeing conditions, but were uniformly observed using the 0.5 or 0.8-wide slit aligned at parallactic angle and generally at low airmass (sec z $<$ 2). Each target was observed with multiple exposures, dithering in an ABBA pattern along the slit, with total integration times of 240--1200~s depending on target brightness and weather conditions. Before or after each target observation, nearby A0 stars at a similar airmass to the target were observed for both telluric and flux calibration. Internal flat field and argon arc lamp calibration frames were obtained at each target position for pixel response and wavelength calibration. All data was extracted, flat fielded, wavelength calibrated, telluric corrected, and flux calibrated with the Spextool reduction package \citep{Cushing04,Spextool2}.

\section{Optically anchored NIR Spectral Analysis}

L dwarfs exhibit a wide range of $J-K_S$ colors at each optical spectral type \cite[e.g.,]{Schmidt10, Faherty:2012cy} and this color spread poses challenges to the analysis of NIR spectra. The comparative methods commonly used for the analysis of optical data of L dwarfs simply do not work very well for their NIR spectra.
Below, we describe a normalization method for NIR spectra which reduces this broad wavelength color term and how we used a sample of optical and NIR spectra to make optically-anchored spectral average templates. 
Both the normalization method and the spectral templates greatly facilitate the comparative analysis of the NIR spectral morphology of L dwarfs.

\subsection{Method for Normalizing NIR Spectra}
\label{sec:method}

%since it makes it difficult to directly compare objects of similar spectral type
%It is difficult to directly compare spectra of objects with disparate colors, but similar spectral types, estimatepecially when normalized at a single wavelength.
Common practice is to normalize NIR spectra of L~dwarfs at the $J$-band peak (1.28--1.32~$\micron$) \citep[e.g.,][]{Kirkpatrick10}. 
In the top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:L1fan}, we show the 0.8--2.4~$\micron$ spectral range for 17 field gravity, optically-typed L1 dwarfs normalized in this manner.
Despite all of the objects having the same optical spectral type and appearing to have similar NIR spectral morphology, the spectra `fan out'. 
That is, while the spectra lie on top of each other near the normalization point, they gradually diverge from one another at both shorter and longer wavelengths, as would be expected for objects having a range of $J-K$ colors. 
This fanning effect makes analyzing the similarities or differences in the spectral shapes and absorption features difficult no matter where the spectra are normalized.

%Despite the fanning out, it appears as though the spectra share very similar absorption features, but each is modified by a smooth function that affects the entire 0.8--2.4~$\micron$ wavelength range. 
%We call the smooth function causing the fanning out effect, the ``reddening term''.
%We hypothesize that the reddening is caused by a gravity-sensitive population of small dust grains ($<1$~\micron) intrinsic to the L~dwarfs atmosphere, not due to intervening interstellar dust, and will be discussed in detail by \citet[in prep.]{Hiranaka13}.

As was pointed out over a decade ago by \citet{Leggett:2003tm}, despite the different spectral slopes, when the $H$ and $K$ bands of objects of the same optical spectral type are separately scaled and overlaid, the agreement between the spectral morphologies is excellent.
In order to directly compare the absorption features in L~dwarf spectra, we utilize this plotting method where each NIR band is normalized separately, using most of the wavelength range of each band. 
Specifically, we use the following normalization ranges: 
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
\item 0.87--1.39~$\micron$ for the $YJ$~band,
\item 1.41--1.89~$\micron$ for the $H$~band, and 
\item 1.91--2.39~$\micron$ for the $K$~band, 
\end{itemize}
which excludes the noisiest parts of the spectra in the water bands.
These three regions were chosen because they are naturally separated by the strong water absorption bands present in both the L~dwarf's and Earth's atmospheres. 
%We did not break up the spectrum into smaller regions in order to enable the comparison of the broad band absorption features (e.g., CO, FeH) and spectral morphology.
Once normalized in this manner, the effect of the color term is substantially reduced and it becomes evident that the low-resolution spectral morphology among normal L~dwarfs of the same optical spectral type are very similar. 
The same objects shown in the top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:L1fan} that fan out over the 0.8--2.4~$\micron$ range are shown in the bottom panel plotted band-by-band, using the above defined normalization ranges for each, and the spectral similarities between the objects stand out much more clearly.

With this plotting method, the color term present in the NIR spectra of L~dwarfs is approximated as a three component piece-wise step function. Since the reddening contributing to the color term has been found to be well described by a smooth function \citep{Hiranaka13,Marocco:2014kr}, there is likely still a small amount of residual reddening remaining within each band.

This normalization method can be used when comparing spectra of objects with very different colors but with similar absorption features. As discussed further in \S~\ref{sec:temp}, this normalization method minimizes the broad band effects likely due to cloud properties while highlighting the molecular absorption features.

\subsection{Making optically-anchored NIR spectral average templates}
\label{sec:templates}

Spectral average templates are a common technique used in stellar and extragalactic spectroscopy to reveal the most common spectral morphologies and average out any variable effects.
SDSS spectra have been used to make M and L dwarf templates in the far-red/optical wavelength regime \cite{Bochanski07_templates, Schmidt:2014jc} but no set of templates have been widely adopted for \emph{NIR} spectra of L dwarfs.
In this section we describe how we used L dwarf spectral dataset to create spectral average templates which are anchored to the optical classification and accurately reflect both the typical spectral morphology of L dwarfs and the variations of their spectral morphology.

Using the sample and data described in \S~\ref{sec:sample}, we have combined the NIR spectra of objects of the same optical spectral type to make NIR spectral average templates for normal and low-gravity L~dwarfs at each integer spectral type, L0--L8. (Since our analysis is anchored in the optical, we do not have an L9.) The resulting templates, grouped by \emph{optical} spectral type, are shown in Figure Sets~\ref{fig:field_templates} and \ref{fig:lg_templates}.
Below, we further describe the methods used to construct the templates.

\textbf{DUPLICATION WITH SAMPLE SECTION? IS THIS NECESSARY?}\\
We started with the opt-NIR sample (180). 
These were divided into two samples, 
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item the field gravity sample with 145 objects that are similar to the \citet{K99} field spectral standards.
	\item and the low-gravity sample with 35 objects with low-gravity features like those described in \citet{Cruz09_lowg}.
\end{enumerate}

Enough Betas and gammas in L0 and L1 to separate.
Betas included in L2-L5 low gravity templates.
while betas and gammas look different in the optical, they dont look that much different in the NIR

For each spectral type, the NIR spectra were normalized and averaged together band-by-band to make first templates in each band. Objects with half-integer spectral types were rounded down to the integer type.
The templates are calculated using the weighted average flux at each pixel. 
The reduced $\chi^2$ was then calculated for each object compared to the template.
Objects with reduced $\chi^2$ values greater than two in any band were excluded from the next calculation of the template for every band.
This process iterated 3-6 times until the reduced $\chi^2$ value stabilize. 
The average $\chi^2$ values of the spectra included in the spectral averages are close to 0.9. 
A $\chi^2$ cutoff of 2 was chosen because it balanced our desire to 1) include more objects than exclude and 2) not include objects with peculiar spectral morphologies. 
This iterative process resulted in 133 objects being included in the spectral average templates (Tables~\ref{tab:field_template} and \ref{tab:lowg_template}) and 47 excluded (Tables~\ref{tab:field_excluded} and \ref{tab:lowg_excluded}). 

For the L1 field gravity objects, a $\chi^2$ limit of 2 excluded mostly bluer objects and did not result representative sample of field L1s being included in the template.
In order to accurately reflect the range of spectral morphologies spanned by L1, the $\chi^2$ limit was increased to 2.3.

L1 field gravity - using $\chi^2 > 2.3$ due to large number of objects.

L1 low gravity - rejected one object by eye. 2M0227-1624. four objects total, 3 kept, 1 rejected. 

Only one L3 and L4 beta, G19-3B and 04070752+1546457, so didnt make a template.
%L5 low gravity used $\chi^2 > 1.7$ due to small number of objects.

L7 field used $\chi^2 > 1.4$ due to small number of objects.

L8 field used $\chi^2 > 1.4$ due to small number of objects.

%The width of the gray strip surrounding the template illustrates the range of spectral shapes found at each spectral type. 
%Given the relatively large number of objects and $J-K_S$ colors spanned at each type, we expect that these strips encompass normal and that the spectra of all normal L dwarfs fall within this range. 
%We also think the range is dominated by intrinsic properties, not instrumental or atmospheric effects.



The resulting spectral average templates of field gravity objects are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:field_templates} and discussed in \S~\ref{sec:fieldg} while the low-gravity templates are in Figure Set~\ref{fig:lg_templates} and discussed in \S~\ref{sec:lowg}. 
The average is is shown as a black line, the dark gray indicates the 1$\sigma$ variance at each pixel, and the light gray indicates the flux range (minimum and maximum flux values) at each pixel of the spectra used to calculate the template. 
The optical spectra were smoothed to approximately match the resolution of the NIR spectra, and their flux range strip is indicated in light gray.
Objects included in the template spectrum for each subtype are listed by increasing $J-K_S$ color to emphasize the range of colors spanned at each subtype.

Within the population of normal L dwarfs at each spectral type, there is likely a range of underlying cloud and gravity properties amongst objects with similar temperatures.
These same differences are also likely causing the different reddening terms that results in the range of $J-K_S$ colors. \citet{Hiranaka13,Marocco:2014kr} is using modeling to constrain the cloud properties that could be causing this range of effects.

Spectra excluded from the templates are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:field_excluded} and \ref{fig:lowg_excluded}.


The analysis presented here is anchored in the optical and thus we do not have an L9 template.
While the optical system of \cite{K99} only goes to L8, \cite{Geballe02} introduced an L9 type, mostly to maintain smoothly varying infrared spectral indices.
They define the beginning of the T dwarf sequence as the first appearance of the 1.6$\micron$ methane absorption feature in the $H$ band.
All L8s display the 2.2$\micron$ methane absorption feature in $K$ band.
While we do see a larger variety of spectral morphologies in the NIR among the optically-classified L8s, we do not see any trends in the spectral features which justify a spectral class later than L8.

%As more and higher signal-to-noise SpeX Prism spectra of L~dwarfs with both optical and NIR data become available, especially at later spectral types, we intend to update the templates. 
%As more objects are added and lower signal-to-noise data are replaced, the templates will provide a more accurate reflection of the spectral morphologies spanned at each spectral type.
%We do not expect the spectral average itself to change that significantly but rather we expect the range and variance to change. 
%Specifically, we expect the variance to decrease as more objects are added. The range could increase as more objects are added or could decrease as higher signal-to-noise data are obtained.

%We discuss how these templates can be used to spectral type in later sections.

\section{Analysis: Field Gravity L Dwarfs}
\label{sec:fieldg}

shown in Figures and summarized in tables.

% The variety of NIR spectral morphologies among L dwarfs of similar optical spectral type has been attributed to the NIR spectra being more sensitive to physical parameters such as gravity, clouds, and metallicity compared to higher-mass stars.
% Optical spectra morphologies, on the other hand, are dominated by temperature and relatively insensitive to the higher order properties. As such, the spectra of so-called `red' and `blue' L dwarfs look peculiar in the NIR but relatively `normal' in the optical.
% In addition, optical spectral types have been shown to be reliable temperature and absolute magnitude indicators \cite[Figure 7 and 9]{Kirkpatrick05},\cite{Faherty:2012cy}.

% In order to to disentangle the observational indicators of temperature, gravity, cloud, and metallicity properties in the NIR spectra of L~dwarfs, we have performed an analysis of NIR spectra using the optical spectra as an anchor.
% That is, by studying the NIR spectra of objects with very similar optical spectra, we have controlled for temperature (as much as possible) and thus, the observed spectral differences in the NIR spectra are most likely attributable to the second order properties.
%Further, unlike previous NIR spectral studies of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, we plot and analyze the three NIR bands ($J$, $H$, and $K_S$) separately as described above in \S~\ref{sec:method}.
%By examining the NIR spectra band-by-band, we are minimizing the effect of reddening on the spectral shape that is likely dominated by the gravity- and metallicity-sensitive clouds and not temperature.


\subsection{Characterizing the Field Gravity Template Subsample}
\label{sec:templates_normal}

In Figure~\ref{fig:JK_colors}, we show the 2MASS $J-K_S$ color versus spectral type distribution for the entire optical-NIR sample of L~dwarfs. The plot shows the colors of the individual L dwarfs (filled circles) as well as the average color at each spectral type (black bar). All of the objects have reliable 2MASS photometry with uncertainties smaller than 0.1~mag. 

The end caps mark the minimum and maximum of the distribution, the whiskers mark the bottom and top quartiles, the box indicates the locations of the 2nd and 3rd quartiles, and the median is indicated with a bar. The number of objects used in calculating the quartiles are indicated above the end caps.

The number of objects included in each template, the mean, minimum, maximum, and range of $J-K_S$ colors is listed in Table~\ref{tab:sample_prop}. 

In order to put the field-gravity optical-NIR sample in the context of the larger normal L~dwarf population, we compare our $J-K_S$ color averages with those of \citet{Faherty13_0355}. 
They compiled a sample of photometrically-defined normal field L~dwarfs with photometric uncertainties smaller than 0.1~mag. 
The Faherty et al. averages are plotted next to those of our normal optical-NIR sample in Figure~\ref{fig:JK_colors_F13}. 
The range of $J-K_S$ colors spanned by each sample are indicated by vertical lines at each spectral type, and the number of L~dwarfs used to calculate each average is indicated above each color range. 
The average colors of the field-gravity optical-NIR sample agree well with the average colors of Faherty et al's less-restrictive normal field sample from L0--L3.
The L4 and L5 bins in our optical-NIR sample might be a little red biased.
The L7 and L8 bins in both samples suffer from small numbers (N$\le10$). 

Not surprisingly, the color range of our more restrictive and spectroscopically cleaned sample is not as large as the Faherty et al. larger, photometrically-selected sample. 


Figure~\ref{fig:JK_colors} demonstrates that the $J-K_S$ color range of the normal optical-NIR sample is well sampled from L0--L5. 

Given these properties, we believe that we have compiled a sample representative of normal L dwarfs from L0--L5 which can be used to disentangle various observational indicators of underlying physical properties as described below.

On the other hand, the field-gravity optical-NIR sample is not representative of the entire L dwarf population for the late spectral types, L6--L7, especially. 
This incompleteness is due to both the red-bias of the 2MASS-selected sample and the intrinsic low luminosities of late L~dwarfs.
These two selection effects result in there being fewer late-type L dwarfs discovered and less follow-up spectroscopy being available for those that are known.
Despite our efforts to identify as many late-type L dwarfs as possible from the literature with both optical and SpeX Prism spectra, with only four L6s and three L7s, the numbers are still too low to consider the sample representative at these spectral types.
However, given the agreement between the spectral morphologies of these spectra, we have chosen to include them in the analysis described below.


\subsection{Isolating Temperature: The Field L Dwarf Spectral Sequence}
\label{sec:temp}
The normal L dwarf $J$, $H$, and $K_S$ low-resolution spectral templates described in the previous subsection are shown overplotted on top of each other in Figure~\ref{fig:spec_sequence}. 
The prominent atomic (\ion{K}{1}, \ion{Na}{1}) and molecular (FeH, H$_2$O) absorption spectral features from L0 to L5 form a clear sequence in all three bands (top panel).
These same spectral features in the later type objects (L6--L8), however, saturate (H$_2$O) or disappear (FeH, \ion{K}{1}) and do not follow the same trends as the earlier type objects and are therefore plotted separately (bottom panel).

%The blackbody curves for 2000, 1800, and 1600~K (with by-eye normalizations) are shown as dotted lines on the L0--L5 sequence. 
%While there is likely molecular absorption at all wavelengths, the emergent spectra must still bear the imprint of the underlying blackbody spectrum.
%The optical and $J$-band spectra are principally comprised of the steep Wien tail of the blackbody curve,
%the $H$ band is near the peak of the curve, while the $K$-band is comprised of the Rayleigh-Jeans tail.
%Indeed, the Wien tail appears to be dominating the spectral slope of the $J$ band and the relative height of the $J$-band peak at 1.3~$\micron$.
%Because the slope of the Wien tail is much more temperature sensitive than the shape of the blackbody peak or the Rayleigh-Jeans tail, this might substantially explain why the far-red optical and $J$-band spectra are more highly correlated with temperature.

Below, we describe how the spectral features in the low-resolution L0--L5 template sequence change, as shown in the top panels of Figure~\ref{fig:spec_sequence}. (The L6--L8 spectra do not follow this sequence.)
While these trends have been known since the early studies of L dwarfs in the NIR \citep{Testi01,Reid01_NIR,Geballe02}, we would like to call out their prominence in the optically-anchored templates.
Since these templates are anchored to the optical spectral types, which has been shown to be primarily sensitive to temperature, we deduce that these NIR spectral changes are also primarily modulated by temperature.
With later type (cooler temperature), 
\begin{itemize}
\item the spectral slope in $J$ band gets redder 
%likely due to the changing steep slope of the temperature-sensitive Wien tail of the underlying blackbody spectrum and the pressure-broadened K wing
\item FeH absorption (1.0, 1.6~$\micron$) increases,
\item VO absorption (1.06, 1.18~$\micron$) decreases,
\item H$_2$O absorption (1.4, 1.9~$\micron$) increases,
\item the slope of the blue side of $H$ band and the red side of $K$ band increases (e.g., water absorption is less broad, but deeper), 
\item the $K$ band shape becomes more sharply peaked,
\item the presence of \ion{Na}{1} (1.14, 2.2~$\micron$) becomes less common, and
\item the strength of CO absorption does not significantly change.
\end{itemize}

The transition to L6 in the NIR spectra is marked most notably by the reversal of FeH absorption (1.0, 1.6~$\micron$). 
At L6 the FeH absorption begins to weaken and is not present by L7. 
%(This feature is measured by the FeH$_z$ index defined by \citet{Allers:2013hk} and this trend is shown in their Figure~20 by the shaded gray region.) 
The disappearance of FeH results in a smoother $J$ and $H$~band spectral shape in the later-type objects. In addition, the onset of water at 1.1~$\micron$ contributes to the smooth $J$-band shape in the later-type objects. Following the trend seen in L0--L5, the depth of the water bands continue to increase and \emph{narrow}---due to the fewer rotational transitions at lower temperatures---resulting in steeper slopes on the blue sides of the $H$~and $K$~bands. 
%(The $H$-band slope is measured by the \citet{Allers07} H$_2$O index and this trend is shown in the top panel of their Figure~5 by red diamonds.) 
In these later types, the $K$-band slope towards the CO is much steeper. 
Finally, L8 is marked by the onset of methane absorption in the $K$-band. 
(The \citet{Geballe02} system uses the onset of methane in the \emph{$H$ band} as the beginning of the T dwarf sequence.) 

%Unlike in the optical, where, by definition, the spectra of the subtypes are different from one another and change smoothly as a function of type \citep{Kirkpatrick05}, the NIR spectra of different subtypes clump together at some wavelengths.
%This is evident in the striking similarity of the $K$ bands of the L2 and L3 templates.
%This is at least partially due to the $H$ and $K$-bands being in the peak and Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the spectral energy distribution which is not as sensitive to temperature as the steeper Wien tail at shorter wavelengths.

Tables ~\ref{tab:lowg_template}, \ref{tab:lowg_excluded}, \ref{tab:lg_sample_prop}.}

\subsection{Characterizing the Low Gravity Template Subsample}
\label{sec:templates_lowg}

As described in \S~\ref{sec:templates}, we used the optical-NIR sample to make optically anchored spectral average templates for L0$\gamma$--L4$\gamma$, L0$\beta$, and L1$\beta$.
The low-gravity templates are shown in Figure Sets~\ref{fig:beta_templates}--\ref{fig:gamma_templates} and the targets included in them are listed in Table~\ref{tab:lowg_template}.
The spectra rejected from the low gravity templates are shown in Figure Set~\ref{fig:lowg_excluded} and listed in Table~\ref{tab:lowg_excluded}.
This sample of low gravity objects is small and incomplete but the striking homogeneity of their NIR spectral morphologies amongst objects of the same optical spectral type provided strong motivation for making templates.

In Figure~\ref{fig:spthist}, we show the spectral type distribution for the low-gravity objects included in the optical-NIR sample of L dwarfs as red and orange bars.
Of the \sample~objects in the optical-NIR sample described in \S~\ref{sec:sample}, \optLowG~are objects with low-gravity features in their optical spectra.
The low-gravity sample is composed of objects from \citet{Cruz07,Kirkpatrick08,Cruz09_lowg} and ten additional objects with new data presented in \S\S~\ref{sec:obs_new_opt} and~\ref{sec:obs_new_nir}.
Several low-gravity objects are not included in this analysis due to their southerly declinations and lack of SpeX Prism data. Future work will attempt to include data from a wider variety of NIR instruments.

As described in \cite{Cruz09_lowg}, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ suffixes are used on the spectral types to indicate very low-gravity and intermediate-gravity spectral features, respectively.
Included in the \optLowG~low gravity objects are 23 L0--L4 objects with a $\gamma$ gravity classification and six L0--L1 $\beta$ type objects.
Of the~\optLowG, only three (listed in Table~\ref{tab:lowg_excluded}) were excluded from the templates and all primarily due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of their NIR spectra, not because of their inconsistent spectral morphology (Figure Set~\ref{fig:lowg_excluded}).

In Figure~\ref{fig:JK_colors}, we show the 2MASS $J-K_S$ color versus spectral type distribution for the field (black and gray) and low gravity objects (red and orange) included in the optical-NIR sample of L~dwarfs.
The mean color of the objects included in the templates is marked as a solid circle and box and whiskers are used to show the quartile ranges of the colors spanned at each spectral type. Excluded objects are indicated by crosses.
The number of objects included in each template and descriptive statistics about their $J-K_S$ color distributions are listed in Table~\ref{tab:lg_sample_prop}. 

Not surprisingly, the $J-K_S$ color distribution of the low-gravity objects is significantly redder than the field gravity objects. 
However, the two distributions also have notable overlap: There are objects with quite red colors for their spectral type that do not have any recognized signatures of low gravity in their optical or low-resolution NIR spectra.
This further supports the notion that most low gravity objects are red, but not all red objects are low gravity.
While diversity of cloud properties is often pointed to as the primary suspect for the red colors of low gravity objects, a significant amount of further theoretical and observational work is needed to pinpoint the nature of the physical properties modulating the $J-K_S$ colors of L dwarfs.

\subsection{The low-gravity spectral sequence}

The optically anchored low gravity L0--L4 $\gamma$ dwarf $J$, $H$, and $K_S$ low-resolution spectral templates are shown overplotted on top of each other in Figure~\ref{fig:lg_sequence}. 
The low gravity $\gamma$ sequence does not have as big of spectral morphology changes between types as the field sequence does (Figure~\ref{fig:spec_sequence}).
Many of the trends are similar to the field L0--L4 sequence but different in magnitude:
J band gets redder, atomic lines (\ion{K}{1}, \ion{Na}{1}) get weaker, molecular FeH absorption gets weaker, H$_2$O absorption gets stronger. 

The differences between field and low g NIR spectra are discussed in detail in the following subsections.
summarize here.
the differences in low g NIR spectra have been outlined before: Allers, Gagne, etc.
what makes low gravity different from field objects
\begin{itemize}
\item J band slope is redder
\item FeH absorption 1.0~$\micron$ is weaker
\item VO absorption (1.06, 1.18~$\micron$) is stronger
\item \ion{K}{1}, \ion{Na}{1} at WAVELENGTHS is weaker
\item H$_2$O absorption (1.4, 1.9~$\micron$) is stronger and slopes are steeper?
\item H band is triangular: 1.6~$\micron$ FeH is not present and slopes
\item red side of the H band slope is steeper, but similar from L2--L4 
\item blue side of the K band slope is stepper, but similar from L2--L4 
\end{itemize}

Trends in the L0--L4 recognized gravity sensitive features
\begin{itemize}
\item the spectral slope in $J$ band gets redder 
\item FeH absorption (1.0~$\micron$) doesnt appear to change that much,
\item VO absorption at 1.06~$\micron$ decreases and is gone by L4,
\item VO at 1.18~$\micron$ stays about the same throughout the sequence
\item \ion{K}{1}, \ion{Na}{1} at WAVELENGTHS decreases 
\item H$_2$O absorption (1.4, 1.9~$\micron$) increases,
\item K band slopes get steeper. 
\end{itemize}

We suspect that the K band might be quite diagnostic and we have ongoing efforts to quantify this shape and see if it can be used as a diagnostic (Buzard et al. in prep)

compare these trends with indices figures? Allers? Gagne?

\subsection{beta vs gamma}

Only four objects, but the two L1 betas and gammas are distinct spectroscopically in both the optical and NIR.

The L1 betas have strong K absorption in K band while the gamma does not.


\subsection{Isolating gravity: Low-gravity templates compared to the field gravity templates} 

One of the most pressing uses of these results is to reliably distinguish field-gravity L dwarfs from low-gravity and potentially young L dwarfs. 
In the following subsections, we compare each low gravity template to the suite of field gravity templates and highlight the distinguishing features.

\subsubsection{L0$\gamma$}
In Figure~\ref{fig:L0lg-field} the L0$\gamma$ spectral average template (blue) is compared to the field L dwarf templates (black,gray).  
The $J$ and $H$ bands of the L0$\gamma$ template are distinctive from the field L dwarf templates. 
In particular, the $J$ band of the L0$\gamma$ type displays weaker FeH absorption at 0.99--1.007 $\mu$m and stronger VO absorption at 1.05--1.08 $\mu$m and triangular-shaped H band compared to the field objects \citep{Kirkpatrick06}. 
Aside from these notable differences, the $J$-band shape is most similar to L0 and L1 field templates, but with a slightly redder slope. 
The L0$\gamma$ $K$-band shape, on the other hand, is only subtly different from the L0 and L1 field objects, with a slightly flatter and less round shape and weaker CO absorption band head at 2.3~$\mu$m. 
\emph{On the basis of these data, we conclude that in order to use low-resolution NIR data to credibly distinguish an L0$\gamma$ from a field object, a $K$-band spectrum is insufficient and $H$- and/or $J$-band data is required.}

\subsubsection{L0$\beta$}
In Figure~\ref{fig:L0b-field} the L0$\beta$ spectral average template (blue) is compared to the field L dwarf templates (black,gray).  
WORDS

\subsubsection{L1$\gamma$}
In Figure~\ref{fig:L1lg-field} the L1$\gamma$ spectral average template (light blue) is compared to the field L dwarf templates (black,gray).

\emph{On the basis of these data, we conclude that in order to use low-resolution NIR data to credibly distinguish an L0$\gamma$ from a field object, a $K$-band spectrum is insufficient and $H$- and/or $J$-band data is required.}


\subsubsection{L1$\beta$}
In Figure~\ref{fig:L1b-field} the L1$\beta$ spectral average template (red) is compared to the field L dwarf templates (black,gray).

\subsubsection{L2$\gamma$}
In Figure~\ref{fig:L2lg-field} the L2$\gamma$ spectral average template (green) is compared to all the other field L dwarf templates (black,gray). 
The L2$\gamma$ type is distinctive from field dwarfs in all three $J$, $H$, and $K$-bands. 
Even more pronounced than in the L0$\gamma$, the L2$\gamma$ J-band spectrum has weaker FeH and stronger VO molecular absorption compared to field L dwarfs. 
In addition, there is also a hint of weaker \ion{K}{1} absorption at 1.25~$\mu$m. Aside from these differences in particular absorption features, the overall shape of the L2$\gamma$ $J$-band is most similar to the L5 field template (not shown).
The L2$\gamma$ $H$-band most closely resembles that of the L7 field template but with the hallmark  triangular-shape. 
Finally, the L2$\gamma$ $K$-band shape resembles that of early-type (L0--L2) field objects, except with a redder overall slope and weaker CO at 2.3~$\mu$m. 
\emph{On the basis of these data, we conclude that in order to use low-resolution NIR data to credibly distinguish an L2$\gamma$ from a field object in the NIR, either a $J$, $H$, or $K$-band spectrum is sufficient.}

\subsubsection{L3$\gamma$}
In Figure~\ref{fig:L3lg-field} the L3$\gamma$ spectral average template (orange) is compared to all the other field L dwarf templates (black,gray).

\subsubsection{L4$\gamma$}
In Figure~\ref{fig:L4lg-field}, the L4$\gamma$ spectral average template (dark red) is compared to all the other field L dwarf templates (color). 
The NIR spectra of the L4$\gamma$ is not as distinctive from the field objects as the earlier type $\gamma$ objects. 
The $J$ band of the L4$\gamma$ template looks very similar to the field L4 but with weaker 1$\micron$ FeH absorption and a redder overall slope. 
Just like the earlier-type $\gamma$ templates, the triangular-shaped H band is quite distinctive from the H band shape of the field objects. And similar to the L2$\gamma$, the H-band of the L4$\gamma$ template most resembles that of the L7 field template.
Finally, the L4$\gamma$ $K$-band shape most resembles that of the earlier-type (L1--L3) field templates, but with weaker CO absorption at 2.3~$\mu$m.
\emph{On the basis of these data, we conclude that in order to use low-resolution NIR data to credibly distinguish an L4$\gamma$ from a field object in the NIR, a $K$-band spectrum is insufficient and $H$- and/or $J$-band data is required.}

As discussed by \citet[\S~3.2]{Kirkpatrick05} and \citet[hereafter K10]{Kirkpatrick10}, several NIR spectral classification methods for L dwarfs have been proposed that rely on spectral indices and/or do not use the entire NIR spectral regime.
% The \citet{Geballe02} system, one of the more popular systems to date, is insufficient for L dwarfs because it uses only one  index (H$_2$O 1.5$\micron$) for L dwarf classification based on NIR data.
% More recently, \citet{Allers:2013hk} provided an index-based scheme to classify field gravity dwarfs which relies on four narrow-band indices from \cite{Allers07,McLean03,Slesnick04} measuring the slope of the water absorption bands separating the $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands.
% \citet{Allers:2013hk} further provide an index based scheme to distinguish field, intermediate, and low-gravity spectra.
While quantitative, index based schemes are useful, a scheme is also needed which uses spectral standards and the entirety of the spectrum to estimate a type, as in the MK system \citep{Morgan:1984wy}.
K10 identified spectral standards, (hereafter, K10 standards) that provide a $J$-band sequence and a scheme which uses the $H$ and $K$ band data to assign `blue' and `red' suffixes. 
% More recently, \cite{Kirkpatrick10} proposed a suite of NIR standards and a spectral typing scheme that compares the entire 1--2.5~$\micron$ region, normalized at 1.28 $\micron$ (resulting in the ``fan'' described above in \S~\ref{sec:method} and illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:L1fan}), but only requiring a good match to the spectral standard in the $J$ band. 
% Objects with a poor match to the standard in the $H$ and $K$ bands, despite a good $J$-band match, are given a `blue' or `red' suffix. 
Here, we build on the K10 scheme by proposing a method which is anchored in the optical and makes greater use of the spectral morphology in the $H$ and $K$ bands.
Below, we describe a classification method for estimating optically-anchored spectral types for L dwarfs based on NIR data using field and low-gravity templates and/or field- and low-gravity spectral standards.



\subsection{NIR spectral standards}
\subsubsection{Field gravity standards}
\label{sec:field_stds}

Our goal is a classification method which is optically anchored via the spectral average templates described in \S~\ref{sec:templates} and also consistent with the K10 scheme which uses spectral standards. 
Thus, the templates should have very similar spectral morphology to the NIR spectral standards when they are normalized band-by-band.
In Figure \ref{fig:templates-stds} we show the NIR spectral average templates (black and gray) and the K10 spectral standards (colors). 
Since our analysis is anchored in the optical and the L9 subclass is only defined for NIR data, we do not have an L9 template.
%We show the L8 template compared to both the L8 and L9 K10 spectral type standards.
Except at L2 and L7, as described below, the agreement between the standards and the templates is excellent.

The K10 standards were not treated any differently than the rest of L dwarfs when determining their inclusion in the optical-NIR sample used to calculate the NIR templates. 
Six of the ten standards are included in the spectral average template calculation for their spectral type: 2M~0345+2540 (L0), 2M~2130-0845 (L1), 2M~1506+1321 (L3), 2M~2158-1550 (L4), 2M~1010-0406 (L6), and 2M~1632+1904 (L8).
The other four, however, are not included in the template for the K10 assigned NIR spectral type:
\begin{itemize}

	\item The L2 NIR standard, \object{2M~1305$-$2541} Kelu-1, a confirmed binary, was rejected from the templates in $H$ and $K$ band, but not in $J$. As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:templates-stds}, the spectrum of Kelu-1 is slightly different from the standard: the blue slope of the $H$ band is steeper, the width of the $H$-band peak is narrower, and the $K$-band CO absorption is weaker than the template. While the spectrum is still the best fit to the L2 template at all bands and remains typed as an L2 in the NIR, it is not an ideal standard. Of the 13 L2s included in the template, we propose \object{2M~0408$-$1450} as an alternate L2 NIR spectral standard because it is bright, at moderate declination, and has a spectral morphology very similar to the L2 template (Figure~\ref{fig:templates-newstds}).

	\item The L5 NIR standard, \object{2M~0835+1953} is quite faint ($J=15.9$) and has no available optical spectrum. As a result, it is not included in the optical-NIR sample used as the basis for the template construction. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:templates-stds}, despite not having a very high signal-to-noise ratio, the spectrum is a good match to the L5 template in all three bands. Since \object{2M~0835+1953} is so faint, we propose \object{2M~2137+0808} as a secondary L5 NIR standard. It is among the brightest objects included in the L5 template, is at moderate declination, and has a spectral morphology similar to the L5 template (Figure~\ref{fig:templates-newstds}). 

	\item The L7 NIR standard, \object{2M~0103+1935}, is classified as L6 in the optical \cite{K00} and it is included in the L6 template. 
	As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:templates-stds}, it is not a good match to the L7 template and we suggest demoting it as the L7 spectral standard. 
	Of the four objects included in the L7 template, we propose \object{2M~0825+2115} as an alternate L7 NIR spectral standard. 
	It is the brightest of the four objects included in the template and has a NIR spectral morphology similar to them. 
	Even though it is typed as an L7.5 in the optical, it remains the best candidate for an L7 NIR spectral standard and in Figure~\ref{fig:templates-newstds} we show it is a good match to the L7 template.	
		
	\item The L9 NIR standard, \object{2MASS 0255$-$4700}, is classified as an L8 in the optical and is included in the L8 template. 
	
\end{itemize}

The full list of NIR spectral standards reflecting our proposed revisions are listed in Table~\ref{tab:standards}.

\subsubsection{Low-Gravity standards}

We have identified low-gravity spectral standards and listed them in Table~\ref{tab:standards}.
We considered bright objects at intermediate declinations which were included in the spectral average templates. 
Since we think it appropriate to keep the L0$\gamma$ prototype \object{2M~0141$-$46} as an L0$\gamma$ standard, we choose a second L0$\gamma$ with similar spectral morphology at a declination more easily accessible from the northern hemisphere. 
For both L0$\beta$ and L1$\beta$, where we have enough objects to make a spectral average template, we have chosen standards.
However, for the later types, there are not enough $\beta$-type objects known to enable standards to be chosen.

Despite using different selection criteria, four out of our eight proposed low gravity ($\gamma$ or $\beta$) standards are also proposed as \textsc{vl-g} or \textsc{int-g} standards by \citet{Allers:2013hk}, (hereafter AL13) and these are marked in Table~\ref{tab:standards} with a superscript.
The L1$\gamma$, L2$\gamma$, and L3$\gamma$ standards we chose are the same as the \textsc{vl-g} L dwarfs proposed by AL13. 
We chose different standards than AL13 for L0$\gamma$ and L4$\gamma$.
For L0~\textsc{vl-g}, they proposed \object{2M~2213$-$21}. While this object's spectrum is representative of the type---it is included in the L0$\gamma$ template---we decided to choose two of the brighter L0$\gamma$ objects as standards.
For L4~\textsc{vl-g}, AL13 proposed \object{2M~1551+09} however, based on a new optical spectrum (\S~\ref{sec:obs_new_opt}), we type this object as L3.5$\gamma$ thus making it not an ideal L4$\gamma$ spectral standard. 

AL13 identified five candidate \textsc{int-g} L dwarf spectral standards. 
The L0$\beta$ standard we chose is the same as the L0~\textsc{int-g} they identified. 
However, the four other objects they identify as possible \textsc{int-g} standards are problematic for various reasons.
They identified \object{2M~0117$-$34} as a candidate L1~\textsc{int-g} standard however, based on a new optical spectrum (\S~\ref{sec:obs_new_opt}), we type this objects as L1$\gamma$ and its NIR spectrum is included in the L1$\gamma$ template. 
They identified \object{2M~1726+15} as a candidate L3~\textsc{int-g} standard however, based on new optical data (\S~\ref{sec:obs_new_opt}), we type this object as L3.5$\gamma$. 
Two objects they identify as possible \textsc{int-g} standards, \object{2M~0602+39} (L2) and \object{2M~0103+19} (L6) do not have features of low gravity in the optical that would warrant a $\beta$ or $\gamma$ classification (\cite{Cruz07,K00}).
As noted by AL13, in general, the objects classified as $\beta$ show more diversity in their spectral features compared to the $\gamma$ objects. Hopefully as more low-gravity L dwarfs are discovered and studied in detail, an intermediate gravity sequence will be possible.

\subsection{Method for estimating spectral types from NIR data}

In principle, we could set up three spectral typing schemes for the NIR, one for each band, but for simplicity, we propose one scheme that works for multiple or single band data.
We propose a spectral typing scheme that takes advantage of normalizing band-by-band (as described above in \S~\ref{sec:method}), uses spectral standards and the optically-anchored spectral average templates (\S~\ref{sec:templates}), and provides a method to assign spectral types to L~dwarfs with only $H$-~or $K$-band data:
%As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:sequence}, the $H$ and $K$ bands are not as diagnostic of an optically-anchored spectral type as the feature-rich $J$ band.

\begin{itemize}
	\item If $JHK$ spectra are available, normalize the data at 1.28~$\micron$ and compare to the NIR spectral standards as described in K10. Note if the spectrum is unusually red or blue.
	
	\item Normalize the spectra band-by-band as described in \S~\ref{sec:method} and compare to the spectral standards and/or the field- and low-gravity NIR templates to find the best matches in each band.
	The `best' match is the subtype where the spectral shapes look the most similar. The best match is usually bracketed by fair-to-good matches one type later and earlier than the best match.
	The fit in $J$-band is given the most weight, followed by $H$ and $K$ bands. The goodness of the $K$ band match is considered last and relatively poor K-band matches are tolerated if there are good matches in the $J$ and $H$ bands. 
	The features in the $J$ band that determine a good match are the slope of the entire band and the strengths of the various absorption features; the 1.3~$\micron$ peak is not always matched well. 
	A good match in $H$ band is determined by matching the red and blue slopes on either side of the peak and the width of the peak; matching the steppe/shoulder or peak shape of the middle of the band is not as crucial as matching the slopes. 
The features contributing to a good match in the $K$ band are both the blue and red slopes on either side of the 2.13~$\micron$ peak.	
	\item If data are not available in all three bands, $J$ band in particular, there will likely be a range of types that have equally good matches and the spectral type can be reported as a range (e.g., L3--L5). In these cases, the range notation is preferred since L3--L5 implies the types L3, L4, and L5 are all equally probable, whereas L4$\pm$1 implies a best-fit type of L4 using a method with one spectral type precision.
	\item If the target is not a good match to any available standards or field or low-gravity templates, consider a `pec' suffix to indicate the peculiarity of the spectrum. If the spectrum is also unusually red or blue when normalized at 1.28~$\micron$, consider a `red' and `blue' suffix.
	\item Spectral types based on low signal-to-noise data ($S/N\sim15$) can be indicated with a `:' suffix or `::' for very-low signal-to-noise data ($S/N\sim5$). 
	(The use of colons to indicate poor quality data is common practice in stellar astronomy, e.g., \citet{Sanduleak:1988fn}, \cite{Silvestri:2006el}, \citet[Table 12.1]{Gray:2009wd}, and \cite{Covey:2010de}.) For example, L1: could be used to describe a low signal-to-noise spectrum that matches the L1 template best in both $J$ and $H$ bands. L1--L3:: could be used to describe a very low signal-to-noise $K$-band spectrum that matches the L1, L2, and L3 templates all equally well. %($\pm$ is used to indicate the precision of the spectral typing method.)

\end{itemize}	

% K10 also suggests adding `red' and `blue' suffixes for objects that, when normalized at 1.28~$\micron$, have poor fits across the $H$ and $K$ bands due to the slope of the spectrum relative to the standard.
% While the spectral slope information is useful, and possibly diagnostic of the object's cloud properties, this method for assigning the suffix is relatively objective.
% Since, the spectral slope of the object can be assessed via the $J-H$ and $J-K$ colors, we suggest that the bulk color properties of the optical-NIR sample be used to help objectively guide when a red or blue suffix is warranted.
% In Figure~\ref{fig:JK_colors} and Table~\ref{tab:sample_prop}, we show the quartile ranges of the $J-K$ colors at each spectral type.
% We suggest that field gravity objects with $J-K$ colors in the upper or lower quartiles of this distribution be considered for a red or blue suffix, respectively.
% Color alone is not sufficient to warrant a blue or red suffix: the suffix is intended to be used for objects that, when normalized band-by-band, are good matches in $J$, $H$, and $K$ to the field gravity standards or templates but have an unusually steep or shallow spectral slope from $J$ to $K$.
% If the spectrum does not match the field gravity standards or templates, a low gravity or `pec' classification should be considered.

Presently, we do not encourage the use of half-types for spectral types based on low-resolution NIR data.
Compared to the optical sequence, where half-types are warranted, the low-resolution NIR data display a greater diversity of spectral morphologies at each type and the resulting sequence is coarser.
%As a result, the NIR spectral sequence of L dwarfs based on SpeX prism data is coarser and less precise than the optical sequence.
%A NIR spectral sequence based on moderate-resolution spectra may facilitate the introduction of half types in the future.

% Below, we outline two methods: 1) using morphological comparison, making use of both the spectral standards and the templates and 2) spectral indices. Each individual investigator should choose a combination of spectral typing methods (compare to templates, spectral standards, or spectral indices) that is most appropriate for their own dataset and science goals.


%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Obtain data for the \citet{Kirkpatrick10} spectral standards with the same instrumental setup as the target and reduce them in the same way.
%	\item If data are available for the target in more than one band, normalize and examine the spectra band-by-band as described above in \S~\ref{sec:method}.
%	\item Compare observations of the K10 spectral standards to the NIR templates described here. This comparison can test for and help diagnose any systematic problems with the target dataset.
%	\item Visually compare the target to the entire suite of templates and/or spectral standards via normalizing band-by-band and overplotting in order to identify the best matches in all available bands. To find the best matches, consider the following guidelines. Perfect matches between the target and the templates or standards are not required in all three bands. A `good' match is one that lies within the range spanned by the template.
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item The $J$-band match has the greatest weight since all the subtypes are well distinguished from each other in the $J$ band and many $J$-band observations include part of the optical spectrum (which we want to anchor to). 
%			In addition, as discussed above in \S~\ref{sec:temp}, the $J$-band slope appears to be dominated by the steep Wien tail of the blackbody spectrum and is thus more temperature-sensitive than the $H$ or $K$ bands.
%			The features in the $J$ band that determine a good match are the slope of the entire band and the strengths of the various absorption features. 
%			Oftentimes, the 1.3~$\micron$ peak is not matched well (possibly due to temperature differences smaller than the temperature resolution of this spectral typing scheme).
%			\item The $H$ band match is considered second after the J band. A good match in $H$ band is determined by matching the red and blue slopes on either side of the peak and the width of the peak. 
%			This is due to the temperature-sensitivity of the shape of the H$_2$O absorption feature.
%			Matching the steppe/shoulder or peak shape of the middle of the band is not as crucial as matching the slopes.
%			Poor matches to the $H$-band slope by the normal templates and/or standards is a strong indicator for considering a low gravity, `blue', or `pec' type.
%			\item The goodness of the $K$ band match is considered last and relatively poor K-band matches are tolerated if there are good matches in the $J$ and $H$ bands. 
%			The features contributing to a good match in the $K$ band are both the blue and red slopes on either side of the peak.	
%		\end{itemize}
%	\item Adopt a type range
%		\begin{itemize}
%		\item If data are not available in all three bands, $J$ band in particular, there will likely be a range of good matches and the spectral type can be reported as a range (e.g., L3--L5). In these cases, the range notation is preferred since L3--L5 implies the types L3, L4, and L5 are all equally probable, whereas L4$\pm$1 implies a best-fit type of L4 using a method with one spectral type precision.
%	\item If the target is not a good match to any available templates or standards, consider a `blue', `red', `pec' type and indicate with an appropriate suffix. (Templates for these peculiar classes are forthcoming, \citet[in prep.]{Cruz14_young} and preliminary versions are available upon request.)
	
%	\end{itemize}
%\end{enumerate}

%This expansion of the K10 system which utilizes the $H$-~and $K$-band spectra provides a flexible, efficient, and reproducible method for determining L~dwarf spectral types with NIR spectra.

%In addition, since this scheme is tied closely to the optical scheme, discrepancies between optical and NIR-based types should be greatly reduced.



%\subsection{Spectral Typing Notes}

%Below we briefly outline some notes on spectral typing.

%\begin{itemize}
	%\item{\textbf{Colons for Low S/N:}} Spectral types based on low signal-to-noise data ($S/N\sim15$), as is common practice, can be indicated with a `:' suffix or `::' for very-low signal-to-noise ($S/N\sim5$) data. For example, ``L1:'' could be used to describe a low signal-to-noise spectrum that still matches the L1 template best in both $J$ and $H$ bands. ``L1--L3::'' could be used to describe a very low signal-to-noise spectrum that fits the L1, L2, and L3 templates all equally.
	
	%\item{\textbf{Adopt Ranges:}} Since the typing scheme described above is anchored to the optical, we do not think a `nir' suffix is necessary, as has been advocated for in the past (REF?). Instead, since the NIR types are not as precise, especially when $J$-band data is not available, we strongly encourage the use of adopting a range of spectral types for individual L~dwarfs in order to accurately reflect the imprecision and uncertainty in the type and to enable realistic uncertainty estimates on any resulting values based on the type. 

%	\item{\textbf{Half types not supported:}} The methodology we describe here uses low-resolution data and does not support finer precision than integer types. Large datasets and templates of higher-resolution spectra may warrant the introduction of half types in the future.
%\end{itemize}


% For L~dwarfs of interest to any future studies with a pre-existing NIR-based spectral type, we highly recommend that their types be re-estimated using this new method.

% \subsection{Spectral Indices}
% We strongly recommend the morphological comparison of spectra to templates and/or standards in order to estimate a spectral type since it uses the entirety of the data available, however, we understand that some investigators prefer a more quantitative approach via spectral indices. 
% A quantitative analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of the various spectral indices historically used for L~dwarf classification will be discussed in detail by Ferrera et al. (in prep.). 
% We present here those preliminary results which indicate, for normal L~dwarfs, the only index that is a reliable indicator of spectral type is the index defined by \citet{Allers07} that measures the slope of the H$_2$O feature in the $H$~band (shown as shaded region in Figure~\ref{fig:spec_sequence}). \\
% \begin{equation}
% \mathrm{H_2O_{Allers07}} = \frac{F_{\lambda=1.55-1.56}}{F_{\lambda=1.492-1.502}}
% \end{equation}
% 
% Due to the morphological changes in this spectral feature in the later type objects, this index is only reliable for spectral types L0--L5. Ferrera et al. (in prep.) propose to use a $K$-band index to distinguish the late L~dwarfs from the early ones in order to determine if the Allers H$_2$O index is valid for any particular L~dwarf.
% 
% We have used the \sample~objects in the optical-NIR sample to re-derive a polynomial for this index (Figure~\ref{fig:allers} solid line.)
% \begin{equation}
% \mathrm{NIR\ Spectral\ Type} =\frac{\mathrm{H_2O_{Allers07}} - 0.75}{0.40}
% \end{equation}
% 
% If only a spectral index is used to adopt a spectral type, then a range should really be reported. For example, an index value of 1.2 is consistent with spectral types L0--L3 and an index value of 1.3 is consistent with spectral types L3--L8.

% \subsection{Spectral Indices}
% Optical spectral types seem to better reflect $T_{eff}$ and $M_J$ as shown in \citet[figure 7 and 9]{Kirkpatrick05}.
% measured popular spectral indices with previous claim to have good correlation with spectral type:r

%

\section{Conclusions/Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

We have presented \# new low-resolution spectra of late-M and L dwarfs obtained with the SpeX spectrograph.
After defining ``normal'', we have created a sample of \# normal L dwarfs with both high quality optical and NIR spectra that is representative of normal L dwarfs from L0--L5.
We have introduced a new method to analyze the NIR spectra of L dwarfs that effectively removes the reddening term and highlights the spectral features due primarily to temperature. 
This method reveals that the $J-K$ color scatter amongst L dwarfs of the same spectral type is attributable to the spectra having different smooth functions across the entire 1--2.5~$\micron$ range rather than differences amongst individual absorption features.
As will be discussed in detail by \citet[in prep.]{Hiranaka13}, this reddening is most likely due to small dust grains intrinsic to the L~dwarfs atmosphere and not due to intervening interstellar dust, is best described by a power law, and is consistent with being caused by a gravity- and metallicity-sensitive population of small dust grains ($<1$~\micron).

In order to attempt to disentangle the observational indicators of temperature, gravity, cloud, and metallicity properties in the NIR spectra of L~dwarfs, we have performed an analysis of NIR spectra using the optical spectra as an anchor.
Anchoring to the optical and analyzing the spectra band-by-band enabled us to show that L dwarfs of the same optical spectral type do indeed have the common spectral morphologies in the NIR even though they span a wide range of colors.
We combined the relatively large number of optically-anchored L~dwarfs at each spectral type to generate $J$, $H$, and $K$ band spectral average templates. We expect that the spectral morphologies of all normal L dwarfs fall within the range of the objects used to generate the templates. We also think the range is dominated by intrinsic properties, such as cloud and gravity properties, and not instrumental or atmospheric effects.
We demonstrated how the shape of the underlying plank function provides an explanation for the temperature-sensitivity of the optical and $J$-band spectral regions compared to the $H$ and $K$ bands.

described low-gravity templates



We described a spectral typing scheme for L~dwarfs based on NIR data that is 1) anchored to the optical and thus correlated with temperature, 2) takes advantage of the a new method of plotting band-by-band and provides a way to spectral type L dwarfs with only $H$ or $K$ band spectra, and 3) enables the use of high fidelity templates in addition to spectral standards.
Future papers to focus on low-gravity, low-metallicity, and multiple, and peculiar objects. and much further in the future, higher resolution.

The results presented here will make it easier to reliably and consistently identify and classify red, blue, and peculiar objects and represent significant progress in our ability to decode NIR spectra to reveal the underlying physics of L dwarf atmospheres and, in turn, planetary atmospheres.

% \subsection{Defining ``Normal''}
% \label{sec:normal}
% In this paper, we focus on characterizing the population of so-called ``normal'' L dwarfs.
% Ideally, a normal L dwarf is fully contracted, field-age, near-solar metallicity, and has typical cloud properties. 
% However, this is currently not a practical definition since we do not have reliable methods to determine age, metallicity, or cloud properties of L dwarfs.
% One observational definition of normal L dwarfs is objects with photometric and spectroscopic properties consistent with the majority of other L dwarfs.
% In order to be more specific about what is meant by ``normal'' in practice, we provide a brief overview of the language currently in use to describe L dwarfs.
%  
% Objects with $J-K$ colors at the extrema of the range spanned by objects of the same spectral type are the so-called ``red'' and ``blue'' L dwarfs, respectively (see Figure~14 of \citet{Kirkpatrick10} and Figure~9 of \citet{Faherty09}). Some red L dwarfs, but not all, have spectroscopic and kinematic properties consistent with low-gravities and young ages \citep{Cruz09_lowg, Faherty09, Kirkpatrick06, Kirkpatrick08, Kirkpatrick10, Faherty13_0355}. Other red L dwarfs lack any indicators of low-gravity or youth and are instead thought to possibly have thicker, dustier, clouds \citep[e.g.,][]{Looper08_dusty}. Thus, ``red'' is oftentimes synonymous with ``young'' and/or ``dusty''. 
% Similarly, some blue L dwarfs have spectroscopic and/or kinematic properties consistent with high-gravities, thin clouds, and old ages and thus, ``blue'' is typically synonymous with ``old'' \citep{Burgasser08_blue, Faherty09, Kirkpatrick10}. 
% Further, oftentimes red, blue, and L dwarfs with unusual spectral features are collectively called ``peculiar'' L dwarfs because their photometric and/or spectral properties are not typical with the bulk properties of the L dwarf population. 
% 
% A major goal of this paper is to define and characterize normal L dwarfs in order to anchor the analysis and physical intrepretation of the peculiar, and very interesting, L dwarfs.
% 
% Below we outline the exclusive selection criteria that we have used for calling an L dwarf ``normal'':
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item \textbf{Not Young or Low-Gravity}: Normal objects do not have any spectral indications of youth such as peaky (aka, triangular) H band, weak Na or K absorption, or weak pressure broadening \citep{McGovern04, Cruz09_lowg, Kirkpatrick06}.
% 	\item \textbf{Not Old, High-Gravity, or Metal Poor}: Normal objects do not have any spectral indications of low metallicity such as a very blue NIR spectral energy distribution or strong H$_2$O and FeH absorption \citep{Burgasser08_blue}.
% 	\item \textbf{Not Dusty}: Normal objects do not have extremely red NIR spectral energy distributions even if they lack low gravity features.
% 	\item \textbf{Not Peculiar}: Normal objects do not any spectral absorption features that look unusual compared to the majority of other L dwarfs of similar spectral type.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% By excluding young, old, metal-poor, and otherwise peculiar objects, normal L dwarfs have photometric and spectroscopic properties within the observed distribution of the majority of L dwarfs are likely to have field ages, near-solar metallicities, and typical cloud properties. 
% As described in the next subsection, the range of $J-K_S$ colors spanned by normal L dwarfs is substantial ($\sim$0.5~mag) and is likely due to the intrinsic range of ages, masses, and cloud properties present in the normal population.

The L1 field template spectrum is shown in black, which is calculated using a weighted average of all the L1 field objects included in Figure 2.

The gray shading of the strip indicates the variance of the weighted mean flux at each pixel. Darker gray indicates smaller variance. For the optical band, the spectra were smoothed down to a resolution similar to that of the NIR spectra, and their flux range strip is included in light gray ---and not shade-coded as in the NIR bands--- only as illustration.

		\caption{Average 2MASS $J-K_S$ color versus spectral type for two samples of L dwarfs. The squares are the averages $J-K_S$ colors of the L dwarfs in our normal optical-NIR sample, and the circles are the average $J-K_S$ colors of the \citet{Faherty13_0355} compilation of field L dwarfs. The extent of the vertical lines indicates the range of $J-K_S$ colors spanned by each sample at each spectral type. The number of L dwarfs used to calculate the average $J-K_S$ color at each spectral type is indicated above the range. Both samples only include L dwarfs that have photometric uncertainties smaller than 0.1~mag. For spectral types L0--L5, the mean colors of our normal optical-NIR sample are consistent with those of Faherty's larger sample. The difference in color ranges spanned by the two samples is due to the much stricter spectroscopic selection criteria imposed for the optical-NIR sample compared to the photometrically-selected Faherty et al. sample.
